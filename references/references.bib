	abstract = {The Survey Quality Predictor (SQP) is an open-access system to predict the quality, i.e., the reliability and validity, of survey questions based on the characteristics of the questions. The prediction is based on a meta-regression of many multitrait-multimethod (MTMM) experiments in which characteristics of the survey questions were systematically varied. The release of SQP 3.0 that is based on an expanded data base as compared to previous SQP versions raised the need for a new meta-regression. To find the best method for analyzing the complex data structure of SQP (e.g., the existence of various uncorrelated predictors), we compared four suitable machine learning methods in terms of their ability to predict both survey quality indicators: LASSO, elastic net, boosting and random forest. The article discusses the performance of the models and illustrates the importance of the individual item characteristics in the random forest model, which was chosen for SQP 3.0.},

	abstract = {Used a new technology—structural modeling of data from special supplements to regular surveys—to generate estimates of construct validity, method effects (a major source of correlated error), and residual error (mainly random error) for a broad set of measures obtained from 5 national surveys and an organizational survey (total respondents = 1,706). Analysis of these estimates suggested that a typical survey item, when administered by a respected survey organization to a general population sample, can be expected to yield 50–83\% valid variance, 0–7\% method effects variance, and 14–48\% residual variance. Multivariate analysis showed that over two-thirds of the variation in measurement quality could be explained by 13 survey design characteristics; characteristics of Ss explained a small additional portion. Results provide (1) information on design conditions associated with better (or worse) measurement quality, (2) empirically based suggestions for improving measurement quality in future surveys, and (3) a set of coefficients for predicting the quality of measures not studied in the present paper.

  abstract={ Survey research is the most frequently used data collection method in many disciplines. Nearly, everybody agrees that such data contain serious measurement errors. However, only few researchers try to correct for them. If the measurement errors in the variables vary, the comparison of the sizes of effects of these variables on each other will be wrong. If the sizes of the measurement errors are different across countries, cross-national comparisons of relationships between variables cannot be made. There is ample evidence for these differences in measurement errors across variables, methods and countries (Saris and Gallhofer in Design, evaluation and analysis of questionnaires for survey. Wiley, Hoboken, 2007; Oberski in Measurement errors in comparative surveys. PhD thesis, University of Tilburg, 2011). Therefore, correction for measurement errors is essential for the social sciences. The correction for measurement errors can be made in a simple way, but it requires that the sizes of the error variances are known for all observed variables. Many experiments are carried out to determine the quality of questions. The relationship between the quality and the characteristics of the questions has been studied. Because this relationship is rather strong, one can also predict the quality of new questions. A program SQP has been developed to predict the quality of questions. Using this program, the quality of the questions (complement of error variance) can be obtained for nearly all questions measuring subjective concepts. For objective variables, other research needs to be used (e.g., Alwin in Margins of error: a study of reliability in survey measurement. Wiley, Hoboken, 2007). Using these two sources of information, making correction for measurement error in survey research is possible. We illustrate here that correction for measurement errors can and should be performed.},
